Manager:

Hey Salman,

The board is asking to see how volume looked in Q2. I think they just want to see Q2 2022 volume by region and wanted to know if everything was looking good. 
I don’t remember all the region codes – I know NAM ends in 1, EMEA ends in 3, and APAC and LATAM are 2 and 4, but I don’t remember which is which. 
I do know LATAM has the lowest volume so just go ahead and assign that to which ever comes out lowest.

I appreciate your help!
